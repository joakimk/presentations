# Toniq #

A simple and reliable background job library for Elixir

!SLIDE bullets
## Who am I?

My name is Joakim KolsjÃ¶

Ruby developer since 2008

Exploring elixir :)

!SLIDE bullets

Before we get into toniq, let's go through a bit of background

!SLIDE bullets
## Do it yourself?

Background process, easy right?

    @@@elixir
    spawn fn ->
      do_work
    end

Yes, but...

What happens when it crashes?

!SLIDE
## So what to do?

    @@@elixir
    spawn_link fn ->
      do_work
    end

Now we're getting better, this will crash the calling process too!

!SLIDE
## Using a OTP supervisor?

This could work really well. Workers are restarted when they fail.

But messages, e.g. jobs are lost when it crashes.

A building block, but not a complete solution.

!SLIDE bullets
## So I went looking for something that was:

simple to use

familiar to ruby developers

reliable and explicit about error handing

work well in limited environments like heroku<br/>
(redis instead of mnesia or dets)

!SLIDE
## Didn't find anything suitable

Nothing lived up to my expectations.

Could be what to expect in elixir compared to ruby,<br/>
but it's also oppurtunity to do green field development.

**github.com/akira/exq** is interesting if you want resque/sidekiq compatibility.

## Introducing toniq

    @@@elixir
    defmodule LazyWorker do
      use Toniq.Worker

      def perform(sleep: 0), do: # nothing
      def perform(sleep: duration) do
        :timer.sleep duration
      end
    end

    Toniq.enqueue(LazyWorker, sleep: 1000)

No spinning up workers, persisted and run right away.

Pattern matching + erlang serialization.

!SLIDE
## Pipelines!

Using Toniq.enqueue\_to...

    @@@elixir
    def create(conn, params) do
      params
      |> extract_sleep_duration
      |> Toniq.enqueue_to(LazyWorker)

      conn |> text("ok")
    end

!SLIDE
## Concurrency

Basically unlimited by default.

One job = one erlang process.

One VM = 100k+ erlang processes.

!SLIDE
## The journey of building toniq

Very fun experience.

Learned much about OTP from "Elixir in Action"

Already pretty used to functional programming though<br/>
intentionally working that way in ruby (recommended!).

!SLIDE
## A bit different: redis as backup and failover

Toniq runs jobs within the VM that enqueued them.

Redis is used as a backup, not as a message queue.

Takeover of orphaned jobs is done using a redis transaction.<br>

**Simple design to avoid complexity**

!SLIDE
## Good error messages

Making confusing error messages is easy,<br/>
making good ones is not that much more work.

![good error messages](good_error_messages.png)

    [error] Job #19:
    Toniq.TestWorker.perform(:fail_once)
    failed with error:
    %RuntimeError{message: "failing once"}

!SLIDE
## Handling failed jobs

Easy CLI interface to handle failed jobs (which are reported to **honeybadger** or similar tools though error logging).

    @@@elixir
    heroku run iex -S mix

    iex> job = Toniq.failed_jobs |> hd
    %{id: 3, opts: [], worker: LazyWorker}

    iex> # Toniq.retry(job)
    iex> Toniq.delete(job)

    iex> Toniq.failed_jobs |>
         Enum.each &Toniq.retry/1

Admin web UI is planned, contributions welcome.

## Benchmarks (quick jobs)
<br/>

**Sidekiq** (ruby 2.2.3, 4 processes, 1000 threads):<br/>

10 000 quick jobs, in 4.68 seconds, 2136 jobs / second<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
**Toniq** (elixir 1.1.1 / erlang 1.8, 1 process):

10 000 quick jobs, in 1.8 seconds, **5500 jobs / second** (2.5x)<br/>
<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br />

(iMac, mid 2011, quad-core i7, 3.4ghz)

!SLIDE
## Benchmarks (slow jobs: 5 second sleep)
<br/>

**Sidekiq** (ruby 2.2.3, 4 processes, 1000 threads):<br/>

10 000 slow jobs, in 51 seconds,   196 jobs/second

<br/>
<br/>
**Toniq** (elixir 1.1.1 / erlang 1.8, 1 process):

10 000 slow jobs, in 6.8 seconds, **1470 jobs/second** (7.5x)
<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br />

(iMac, mid 2011, quad-core i7, 3.4ghz)

!SLIDE
## Status of toniq?

Error handling works

Concurrency works

Failover works

In production use in a small internal project.

Not yet 1.0 but close.
